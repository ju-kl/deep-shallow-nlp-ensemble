       "\"new COVID-19 patient confirmed in Switzerland: male, 70, infected in Milan during an event 2/15, symptom onset 2/17 service:  blue general surgery  history of the present illness:  mrs.  is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism, iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, increased cholesterol, peptic ulcer disease, chronic constipation, and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  she was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder.  at the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back. she was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss, melena, or bright red blood per rectum.  a cat scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder.  it also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct.  incidentally, it also showed diverticulosis.  a hida scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of cystic duct obstruction.  the first imaging study that was done at  was a mrcp which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis.  a differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis.  in addition, also the mrcp showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder.  of note, at the outside hospital, an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed.  the colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied.  this biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma.  the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital.  hospital course:  the patient was scheduled for an operative date on  and over the next few days she was given a low-residual diet.  she had her belly cleaned with hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed, she was given a bowel prep on monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an exploratory laparotomy on tuesday, .  on the morning of , the patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a cholecystectomy, partial hepatectomy, partial lymph node dissection, a colocolostomy, partial colectomy, and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place.  please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery.  briefly, the surgery on  revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery.  in addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube, two - drains were placed. the patient's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter. however, the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the surgical icu for the first postoperative day.  in addition, the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells.  in addition, on postoperative day number two, the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a dilaudid pca machine.  on postoperative day number two, interestingly, the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology.  the patient's postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia.  on postoperative day number two, an oncology consult with doctor   was obtained and follow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient.  following that, the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus.  her bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six.  the patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake.  on postoperative day number seven, the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds.  she was started on p.o. medicines and her first - drain was pulled due to scant output.  by , the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds.  between the two of those, her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself. she was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care.  therefore, she was discharged on  in good condition.  discharge diagnosis:   metastatic gallbladder cancer.   status post cholecystectomy.   status post transverse colectomy with anastomosis.   g tube placement.   feeding jejunostomy.   hypothyroidism.   blood loss requiring transfusion.  discharge medications:   levothyroxine 100 micrograms orally once a day.   pantoprazole one tablet once a day.   ambien 10 mg orally before bed.   tylenol #3 one tablet every four hours as needed for pain.   reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime.   colace 100 mg twice a day.  discharge instructions:  follow-up with the visiting nurses association to arrange assistance with her tube feeding and her activities of daily living.  the patient is also scheduled for an appointment with doctor  approximately two weeks after her discharge from the hospital.                                , md      medquist36  d:    01:23 t:    13:25 job#:  \""

table whereas the left subdural hematoma measures 7 cm from the inner table. the subdural hematomas have areas of hyperdensity interspersed by lower density areas. these findings likely represent acute on chronic hematomas. there is minimal shift of the midline structures to the left by 4 mm. there is mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. in addition, there appears to be trapping of the temporal  of the right lateral ventricle as it is dilated out of proportion to the remainder of the ventricular system. the suprasellar cistern is patent but has some minimal mass effect upon it. the quadrigeminal plate cistern is patent as well as the basal cisterns. there is atherosclerotic calcification. the -white matter differentiation is preserved. incidental note is made of a chronic left tripod fracture. impression: acute on chronic bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left with mild mass effect. there appears to trapping of the temporal  of the right lateral ventricle.  mri 10/706: there are bilateral mixed signal intensities with predominant hyperintense t1 signal subdural hematomas identified extending from frontal to the parietal region. the hematoma on the right measures 5 cm in the maximum width and the hematoma on the left side measures 2 cm in the maximum width. there is indentation on the adjacent brain with compression of both lateral ventricles. there is no significant midline shift seen. the basal cisterns are patent. there is mild prominence of both temporal horns identified. small amount of blood is also seen along the tentorium on the right side. following gadolinium, no abnormal parenchymal or vascular enhancement seen. there is mild meningeal enhancement identified bilaterally. at the craniocervical junction, no abnormalities are seen. specifically, no evidence of tonsillar herniation is seen. impression: bilateral mixed signal intensity subdural hematomas with hyperintense t1 signal indicating acute/subacute subdurals. the left-sided subdural measures 2 cm and the right-sided subdural measures 5 cm in maximum width. no evidence of herniation is seen. mass effect is seen on both cerebral hemispheres and the ventricles. no evidence of acute infarct.  hct : the patient is status post bilateral parietal craniotomies. there is small amount of hemorrhage at the postoperative site, and small bilateral subdural fluid collections with layering hematocrit posteriorly. there is a small amount of intracranial air. the bilateral subdural collections are greatly decreased in size from  and no longer demonstrate a heterogeneous pattern. there is no shift of midline structures, but there is compression of both lateral ventricles that appear relatively unchanged. there is distortion of the

had ataxia and multiple falls, as well as several weeks of headache, who was admitted to the hospital from the ed due to bilateral subdural hematomas found on ct. the ct an mri showed bilateral acute on chronic and subacute subdural hematomas with multiple membranes in between them and mass effect. he was admitted for observation, and then he was taken to the or for bilateral craniotomies for evacuation on . he was prepared and consented as per standard. his post-operative exam was stable. he had frequent neuro checks and his blood pressure was closely controlled. in the icu, he had one episode of left pupil dilatation, but his hct at the time remained stable and the dilatation resolved spontaneously. it was thought to be secondary to irritation from hemorrhage. he was transferred out of the icu on . he was seen by speech and swallow on , who did not have any reccomendations as they felt his speech and swallowing was intact. he was evaluated by pt and required further treatment. they continued to work with him until his gait had improved and he was cleared for discharge. hospital course was otherwise notable for chest pain, with a normal ekg and negative cardiac enzymes, and an asymptomatic positive blood culture (gpc, ) thought to be a contaminant.  medications on admission: medications prior to admission: - antihypertensive (unable to indicate the tablet

seroma vs hematoma vs abcess. has been imaged by ct w/o contrast, mri, and x-ray. ent scope showed posterior pharyngeal edema between the glottis and epiglotis w/ mild degree of airway narrowing. on broad spectrum antibiotics.  ent rescoped and found no perforation, after which he was transferred to the floor for further management. he underwent a ct guided aspiration of the prevertebral collection.  this was limited to only 5 cc of aspirate which was negative for growth on culture.  subsequent to these results, his meropenem and vancomycin were discontinued. he then underwent a cspine series with flexion and extension radiographs and was determined to have no cervical instability.  his cervical collar was removed without any complications.  fungemia - blood growing  para. from line (). surveilance blood cx negative. was on ampho but secondary to acute renal failure was switched to fluconazole. subsequent to these results, his meropenem and vancomycin were discontinued. tte was negative.  he refused ophthalmologic examination.  acute renal failure - cr up to 2 from baseline of  likely secondary to pre-renal hypovolemia and vanc/ampho.  he was hydrated and switched to fluconazole from amphotericin and his creatinine stabilized around 5  anemia - hct 5 down from 31-34 (baseline). mcv microcytic.  he had no evidence of acute bleeding and his iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  he did receive 2 units of prbcs while on the floor as the hct drifted to below  he will need an outpatient colonoscopy.  ekg consistent w/ wandering atrial pacemaker. echo consistent w/ lvh. couple runs of nsvt, asymptomatic. ruled out for myocardial infarction. he heart rate was maintained on lopressor.  hypertension-he was given iv lopressor while he was npo and this was switched to po after he was able to swallow.  once he tolerated po, his nifedipine was switched to amlodipine as his heart rate did go into the 40s with lopressor.  dysphagia - secondary to prevertebral mass. he initially failed speech and swallow study while in the micu and was made npo, but after being ruled out for esophageal perforation and transfer to the floor, subsequently had no difficulties passing a reevaluation.  he was advanced to soft solids and thin liquids and then to regular diet without difficulty.   medications on admission: zoloft 100 mg po qdaily oral contraceptives, vancomycin, amphotericin, metoprolol, nifedipine, protonix, haldol  discharge medications:  bisacodyl 5 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: two (2) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po qd (once a day) as needed.  heparin sodium (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: one (1) injection tid (3 times a day).  pantoprazole sodium 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours).   fluconazole 200 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po q24h (every 24 hours) for 8 weeks. disp:*112 tablet(s)* refills:*0*  acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed.  docusate sodium 150 mg/15 ml liquid sig: one (1)  po bid (2 times a day).  oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg/5 ml solution sig: 5-10 mls po q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed.  haloperidol 1 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po bid (2 times a day) as needed.  amlodipine besylate 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po qd (once a day). disp:*60 tablet(s)* refills:*2*  metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day). disp:*60 tablet(s)* refills:*2*  gabapentin 100 mg capsule sig: two (2) capsule po tid (3 times a day). disp:*180 capsule(s)* refills:*2*  morphine sulfate 2 mg iv q4h:prn  ondansetron 2 mg iv q6h:prn   discharge disposition: extended care  facility:  healthcare -
